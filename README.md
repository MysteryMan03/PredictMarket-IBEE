# Predict_Market - IBEE
Two different models that "predict" Stock Market trends, this is a project for the Extended Essay in  the International Baccalaureate Program. Neither of these models predicts a percentage increase or decrease in share price, rather it works binomally predicting only whether it will go up or down at a 60% certainty level.

### Model 1 - Linear Regression
- This first model utilizes linear regression, the most basic form of machine learning
- This model can be represented by the equation y = mx + b

### Model 2 - Random Forest
- This model utilizes a random decision forest, this works by:
  1. Creating a number of decision trees, each using a random subset of data,
  2. The system then "votes" on which tree produced the best result, this is known as bagging and can be repeated many times
